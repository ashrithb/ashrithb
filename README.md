### Hi there, I'm Ashrith!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan. I am passionate about technology and coding/developing interesting projects. I also love PC hardware (I enjoy building computers as well) and learning about topics in algorithmic trading. I'm also especially interested in DeFi and Blockchain technologies, and worked on interesting products in this space, such as the Numoen Protocol, an Automated Market Maker that lets liquidity providers hedge against Impermanent Loss on Arbitrum (an Ethereum layer 2) won the best DeFi Hack at Blockchain at Columbia LionHACK! 

I am seeking more opportunities in SWE roles, so please feel free to contact me at ashrith@umich.edu!
